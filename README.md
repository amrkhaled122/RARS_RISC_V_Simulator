# RARS_RISC-V Simulator 

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and testing files for a RARS_RISC-V. The project simulates various algorithms and includes comprehensive testing to ensure functionality.

## Contents

- **Source Code:**
  - `RISC_V_Simulator.cpp`: The main project code implementing the algorithms.

- **Documentation:**
  - `RISC_V_Simulator report.pdf`: A detailed report documenting the project objectives, methodologies, and results.
  - 
- **Output:**
  - `data.txt`: Output generated by the project.
  - `instructions.txt`: Instructions on how to interpret the output.
  - `project_1.exe`: The compiled executable of the project.

- **Testing:**
  - A set of seven test cases to validate the implementation:
     1. Fibonacci sequence.
     2. Maximum in array.
     3. String length.
     4. Binary search.
     5. Array sorting.
     6. Array reversal.
     7. Instructions for testing all components.
  - Each test includes source code, input data, and instructions.
  
## Getting Started

1. **Compilation:** Compile the `project_1.cpp` file using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. **Execution:** Run `project_1.exe` or the compiled executable to generate results.
3. **Testing:** Execute the tests located in the `tests` directory to validate the implementation.
